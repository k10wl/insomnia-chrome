# Insomnia - Chrome Extension

Keep your PC awake and alert with Insomnia. This Chrome extension ensures that your computer does not enter sleep mode inadvertently.

## Features:

- **Lock Screen**: Prevent your PC from going into sleep mode. Activate this by pressing `Ctrl + L`.
- **Release Screen**: Allow your PC to return to its normal state and potentially enter sleep mode when inactive. Use the shortcut `Ctrl + R` to release.

## Important Notes:

- Releasing the lock (either through the shortcut or manually) will also occur when you navigate to a different tab or focus outside of the browser.
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions enabled for this extension to function properly.

## Installation:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/k10wl/insomnia-chrome`.
2. Install the extension manually:
   - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
   - Enable "Developer mode" at the top right.
   - Click on "Load unpacked" and select the directory where you cloned the extension.
3. Done! The extension should now be active in your Chrome browser.
